# SimpleBlackjackC
This is a simple blackjack program I made in C for a class. 
It is very basic and does not include betting. 
Because there is no betting in the program there is no double downs or anything like that. Adding a betting system should also be very simple.
This a completely command line program and was made to run on a unix system
